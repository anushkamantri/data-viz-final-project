# Data Visualisation Final Project:  Olympics

## Topic
Our project centers on analyzing global patterns in Olympic success, with a focus on the relationships between athlete demographics, country characteristics, and medal outcomes. The Olympics are a stage where athletic excellence intersects with cultural, economic, and regional dynamics, making it an ideal context for uncovering unique insights through data visualization. By leveraging both athlete and country-level data, we aim to identify key trends and factors that shape Olympic performance.

## Dataset
The [dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-06-04/readme.md) weâ€™re using for this project includes a broad array of information about cheeses, covering details such as name, region of origin, production methods, milk types, fat content, and other defining characteristics, taken from cheese.com. This comprehensive collection of data allows us to examine both qualitative aspects (like milk type and physical attributes) and quantitative factors (such as fat percentage and age) across different cheeses. Each entry in the dataset represents a unique cheese, providing specific insights that let us compare attributes across various cheese types and regions.

## Graphical and Statistical Techniques
To effectively portray our findings, we will use several graph types to make sure that we find the most suitable representation for each one.

To illustrate regional trends and cheese distribution patterns we aim to use (geographical) heatmaps. For example, we can visualise the correlation between textures with flavours to identify common pairings.

We will also use scatter plots for visualising relationships between different features, and to display the distribution of attributes like fat content across different cheese types or regions box plots and histograms will be the most suitable. 

Another graph we plan on creating a stacked bar chart in order to show the distribution of milk types (cow, goat, sheep, etc.) used in cheeses across different countries or regions. From this, we could examine how the type of milk used reflects regional livestock and traditions.

We also plan to utilise the various statistical methods we have learned in class to create and present visualisations and tell a meaningful story about cheeses:

**Descriptive Statistics:**
To understand the dataset and identify key figures, patterns, or outliers.

**Correlation Analysis:**
By analysing correlations between variables such as fat content, milk type, and region, we hope to uncover significant relationships.

**Regression Analysis:** 
We may use regression models to identify influential predictors to predict characteristics like flavour intensity or texture based on quantitative variables (such as fat content, milk type).
